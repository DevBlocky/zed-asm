# Zed Assembly Syntax

Extension for [Zed](https://zed.dev) that adds assembly syntax highlighting and [`asm-lsp`](https://github.com/bergercookie/asm-lsp) support.

### Note for Windows Users:

As a 2025-06-12, there is no prebuild binaries for Windows, so you will need to get `asm-lsp` and add it to `$PATH` yourself.
